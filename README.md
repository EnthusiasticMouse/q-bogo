# Quantum Bogo Sort #

The Bogo sort is a joke algorithm that sorts a list by randomising the list until it is sorted! As you can imagine this takes a <b> VERY </b> Long Time.

My Spin on this algorithm is that this version uses a Quantum computer to superposition a Qubit, then measure the qubit. 
By doing this repeatedly many times we can turn the bits into randomied binary numbers, and use them to shuffle the list!

This takes equally long, but was a fun little project to introduce me to how Q# handles quantum logic gates!
